# Historical-Revenue-Data-Analysis
 Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data for Tesla and GameStop and Building a Dashboard

**Historical Revenue Analysis: Tesla & GameStop**

This project is part of the "Python Project for Data Science" course on Coursera, offered by IBM. The goal of this exercise is to extract, parse, and analyze historical revenue data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using Python and web scraping techniques.
------------------------------------------------------------------
**Objective**

Scrape historical financial data from publicly available web sources
Parse HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`
Load and analyze the revenue data for Tesla and GameStop
Visualize the trends in revenue over time
Practice basic data science skills including:

 **Web scraping**
 Data wrangling with `pandas`
 Plotting with `matplotlib`
-----------------------------------------------------
**Tools & Libraries Used**

* Python 3.x
* `requests`
* `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`)
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
---------------------------------------------------

**Data Sources**

The historical data used in this project was sourced from Tesla and GameStop stock and revenue tables hosted on IBM's public cloud object storage for educational purposes. These pages are static and do not require dynamic JavaScript rendering.

------------------------------------------------
**Key Tasks**

The project involves sending HTTP GET requests to access HTML pages, using BeautifulSoup to extract `<table>` data from the HTML, converting the tables into pandas DataFrames, and plotting revenue trends over time.

------------------------------------------------
**Sample Output**

The project includes line charts showing the quarterly revenue progression of Tesla and GameStop, along with observations and insights derived from the revenue trends, such as growth patterns and periods of decline.
